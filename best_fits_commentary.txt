Comments on fit of STO/SRO/BFO/Co/Pt sample b987:

Best fit so far: 
{{3.904`, 3.97`, 4.072`, 4.089`, 3.924`}, {498.8999999999998`, 52.5`, 142.645`, 23.97`, 68.04`}, {500, 53, 157, 24, 69}, {0.201`, 2.201`, 0.001`, 1.`}}

This characterization of the thin film still does not resolve our main issue: fitting the SRO Bragg peak. Other than this one large feature, however, these parameters
in the model fit the data better than past attempts. This characterization could still be improved on with the nonlinear least squares fitting, but this will
give minutely better parameters. The least squares fitting will not address the large SRO peak.
